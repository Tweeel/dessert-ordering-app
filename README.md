DroidCafeInput
==============================

This app created from the Basic Activity template lets a user tap an image
to make a choice. The app displays a Toast message showing the userâ€™s choice.
The app also uses an intent so that when the user taps the floating
action button, it launches the second Activity. The second Activity
demonstrates EditText input controls, radio buttons, and a spinner
for entering the label for a phone number.
